    "The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: Task Queues) is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a task as a message and send it to the queue. A worker process running in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.\n",

We don't have a real-world task, like images to be resized or pdf files to be rendered, so let's fake it by just pretending we're busy - by using the time.sleep() function. We'll take the number of dots in the string as its complexity; every dot will account for one second of \"work\". For example, a fake task described by Hello... will take three seconds.\n",
